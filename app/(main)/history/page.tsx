                        <p className='text-sm my-2'>The industrial revolution that started in Britain in the 1770s spread to India, which was their colony. In 1817, a British industrialist started a textile mill in Howrah, Calcutta, where the industrial revolution began. The establishment of tea and coffee plantations in 1839 and the start of train service in 1853 fueled industrial growth.</p>
                        <p className='text-sm my-2 mb-10'>This industrial growth gave rise to widespread labor exploitation here as elsewhere. The daily wage was 3 annas or 18 nayapaisa even if he worked for fourteen to eighteen hours. Starvation, disease and death were daily occurrences. The inhumane condition of hiding the body, like burying a dead worker, also prevailed.</p>
